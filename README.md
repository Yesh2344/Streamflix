This is a project built with [Chef](https://chef.convex.dev) using [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.
  
This project is connected to the Convex deployment named [`neat-ibex-638`](https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/neat-ibex-638).
  
## Project structure
  
The frontend code is in the `app` directory and is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
  
The backend code is in the `convex` directory.
  
`npm run dev` will start the frontend and backend servers.

## App authentication

Chef apps use [Convex Auth](https://auth.convex.dev/) with Anonymous auth for easy sign in. You may wish to change this before deploying your app.
